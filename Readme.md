Welcome to the **Design Patterns** repository!  
This open-source project provides clear, practical examples of common software design patterns, with a focus on their application in modern JavaScript.  
Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome!

## Introduction

A **design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a recurring problem in software design.  
Patterns are not finished code, but templates that can be adapted to solve specific problems in different contexts.  
They help developers communicate, structure, and maintain code more effectively.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-js.git
   cd design-patterns-js
   ```
2. **Browse the pattern folders** under `/creationaldesignpatterns/` for code examples.
3. **Run examples** using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node creationaldesignpatterns/singleton/index.js
   ```

## When to Use Design Patterns

- Design patterns originated in OOP languages like C++ and Java, but are also valuable in JavaScript and other paradigms.
- Use patterns to solve common design problems, improve code organization, and facilitate team communication.
- Avoid overusing patterns—apply them thoughtfully to prevent unnecessary complexity.

## Types of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to increase flexibility and reuse.

#### Singleton

Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.  
Useful for managing shared resources or configuration.

[Example: Singleton in JavaScript](./creationaldesignpatterns/singleton/index.js)

#### Factory Method

Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
Centralizes object creation logic for better organization.

[Example: Factory Method in JavaScript](./creationaldesignpatterns/factorymethod/index.js)

#### Abstract Factory

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
Ideal for applications that need to support multiple themes or environments.

[Example: Abstract Factory in JavaScript](./creationaldesignpatterns/abstractfactorymethod/index.js)

#### Builder

Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.  
Useful for creating objects step by step.

[Example: Builder Pattern in JavaScript](./creationaldesignpatterns/builderpattern/index.js)

#### Prototype

Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.  
Enables efficient object creation and dynamic inheritance.

[Example: Prototype Pattern in JavaScript](./creationaldesignpatterns/prototypepattern/index.js)

## Notes on JavaScript Usage

- Patterns are conceptual; adapt them to JavaScript's features and idioms.
- Use ES6+ syntax for clarity and maintainability.
- Avoid unnecessary boilerplate—keep implementations idiomatic and concise.
